# Data Wrangling and Cleaning

This repository is dedicated to **data wrangling, data cleaning, and preprocessing** tasks using real-world datasets.

The focus here is not modeling or machine learning, but the often-messy work that makes data usable in the first place.

---

## What This Repository Covers

- Handling missing, inconsistent, and noisy data  
- Data type corrections and normalization  
- Feature cleanup and transformation  
- Outlier detection and basic treatment  
- Dataset restructuring and validation  
- Exploratory checks to assess data quality  

---

## Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for validation visuals)  

---

## Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A learning log for data preprocessing techniques  
- A reference for common data cleaning patterns  
- A practical showcase of working with imperfect, real-world data  

---

## Out of Scope

- Machine learning models  
- Deep learning  
- Model evaluation or deployment  

Those belong in separate, focused repositories.
